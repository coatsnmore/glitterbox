# Gen-App

All code here was generate by Cursor AI using a principal prompt and incrementing refinement prompts.

## Principal Prompt

```
Create a Progressive Web App that stores personal data in local storage. I would like to track daily goals, notes, and a food log. Use any framework that uses modern Javascript, but I don't require a framework either. Think about the goals, common qualities of a web application, and best practices. Implement the best version of a daily wellness tracker and journal.
```

## Example Refinement Prompt

```
there is no service worker registered
```
